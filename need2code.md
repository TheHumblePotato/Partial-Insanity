# Need to Code

## General Rules

1. Don't make irrelevant/unnecessary commits (ex. "I <3 bob")

## BUGS

1. in image rooms, the image doesnt take the full page
2. in image rooms, puzzles can clip out of view
3. in the admin panel, the leaderboard doesn't load

## Visual

1. locks don't looks good
2. need better background

## Suggestions/Features

1. make hints more customized
2. settings page for team
3. show answers only on toggle
4. add ai to get context of puzzle and what the person knows about the puzzle so far, and it returns a hint to what to do next?
5. remove the hide from leaderboard button on team creation
6. add email verifacation.
7. It would be good to store puzzles on firebase instead of github.

## Puzzle Stuff

1. GREMMER
2. i <3 bob
