## BUGS
1. Certain room clears don't get detected (partial solve)
2. in image rooms, the image doesnt take the full page
3. in image rooms, puzzles can clip out of view
4. solving locks linked to a meta doesnt make the meta solved

## Visual
1. scroll bars around pdf
2. locks don't looks good
3. need better background

## Suggestions
1. make hints more customized
2. be able to create 1+ answer boxes in a puzzle
3. create multipuzzles (puzzles with many answers)

## Puzzle Stuff
1. tarting room meta - it says love mr. bob so we think the last name is bob, right? but bob goes in the first answer box where the first name should go...
