# Need to Code

## General Rules

1. Don't make irrelevant/unnecessary commits (ex. "I <3 bob")

## BUGS

1. in image rooms, the image doesnt take the full page [wont use, dont worry]
2. in image rooms, puzzles can clip out of view [wont use either]
3. reporting issue doesn't make it show up in "My Submitted Issues"
4. admin issues page doesnt work

## Visual

1. locks don't looks good
2. need better background
3. aethetic stuff

## Suggestions/Features

1. make hints more customized [i dont think we have enough time]
2. settings page for team
3. show answers only on toggle
4. add ai to get context of puzzle and what the person knows about the puzzle so far, and it returns a hint to what to do next? [not enough time]
5. add email verification. [not necessary...]
6. It would be good to store puzzles on firebase instead of github.
7. secure and move admin panel

## Puzzle Stuff

1. GREMMER
2. i <3 bob
